Platform and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session. Additionally, you may
encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of the Booking Platform that are placed by third parties.
We do not control the use of cookies by third parties. We use cookies from third-party partners such as Google Analytics
for marketing and analytical purposes. Google Analytics helps us understand how our customers use the site. You can read

<P>
  We may share/disclose your personal information internally with our group companies or with other third parties and
  affiliates to provide you access to products and services offered by them. These entities and affiliates may market to
  you as a result of such sharing unless you explicitly opt-out.
  Some of the instances where we may share your personal information are:
  <ul>
    <li>With any relevant third-party service providers such as an airline, hotel, activity service provider(s) who provide
      the end services who may contact you additionally in relation to the services you have requested. You should review
      their Privacy Policy and Terms of Use before sharing any information with them to understand how they process your
      personal information.</li>
    <li>With our data processors who provide storage and other related services to you on our behalf such as cloud service
      providers, payment gateways, customer service providers, survey distributors or any other third-party for the purposes
      of prevention, detection mitigation, and investigation of fraudulent or illegal activities related to our Services or
      prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including safeguarding against and the
      prevention of threats to public security, compliance with our legal obligations, enforcement of our user agreement,
      facilitate our marketing and advertising activities.</li>
    <li> With your consent we may liaise with third party advertising service companies for online behavioral advertising or

      employ cookies and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of websites, applications and to understand the
      booking behavior of the user. We also engage third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data.</li>
    <li> With outside professional advisors (such as accountants, auditors, or lawyers), subject to binding contractual
      obligations of confidentiality.</li>
    <li> With our group companies or affiliates who need to know or have access to such information in relation to
      provisioning of Services.</li>
    <li> With government agencies or other authorized law enforcement agencies if required to do so by law or in the good
      faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal
      process.</li>
    <li> With any relevant third-party acquirer(s), in the event that we sell or transfer all or any relevant portion of our
      business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation). Should such a transaction
      occur, that other business entity (or the new combined entity) will be required to follow this privacy policy with
      respect to your personal information.</li>
    <li> We adhere to appropriate security measures to protect your personal information while we share with them for
      processing. Further, wherever applicable, we bind these third parties with appropriate agreements and require them to
      process your personal information only for specific purposes along with confidentiality and with appropriate security
      measures.</li>
    <li> When you use a co-branded service (a service operated with a partner of Cygnus), or register or otherwise provide
      information on a co-branded site, you grant us permission to pass the collected information back to that partner,
      which may include third party service providers whose services are embedded into and/or appear within the Services.
    </li>
    <li> We may share your information with our partners such as your name, email, or other identifier. Our partners may
      also: (i) collect information directly from your device, such as your IP address, device ID, advertising ID, and
      information about your browser or operating system; (ii) combine user information about you received from Cygnus with
      information about you from other sites or services; and (iii) place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.</li>

  </ul>
  Due to the international nature of our business and in connection with the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, we
  may share your personal information internationally with Cygnus Group of companies, such as Cygnus Private Limited;
  Cygnus MEA FZ LLC, Flyin Private Limited, and to other third parties located in countries that may have different laws
  and data protection compliance requirements to those that apply in the country in which you are located. We would ensure
  appropriate security measures while we transfer these information.
</P>
<h3>Links to other sites</h3>
<p>The scope of this Privacy Policy is limited to the Booking Platform. Our Booking Platform may provide links to other
  websites. If you are accessing any other third-party websites or applications, please refer to their respective
  privacy policies to understand how they process your personal information.</p>

<h3>Security precautions</h3>
<p>To protect your personal information from unauthorised access or disclosure, loss or misuse we have adopted
  reasonable security practices and procedures in line with industry standards. Whenever you change or access your
  account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The transmission of information is not completely secure for
  reasons beyond our control. We adopt industry standard security measures and keep updating our systems from time to
  time to protect your personal information against any hacking or virus dissemination. However, by using the Booking
  Platform, the users accept the security implications of data transmission over the internet and the world wide web
  which cannot always be guaranteed as completely secure, and therefore, there would always remain certain inherent
  risks regarding use of the Booking Platform. Users are responsible for ensuring the protection of login and password
  records for their account. We are not responsible for any breach of security occurring on a third-party platform that
  you may decide to transact with.</p>

  <h3>Use of children information</h3>
  <p>
    Use of our Booking Platform is available only to persons who can form a legally binding contract under the Indian
    Contract Act, 1872. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under the age of 18 years.
    If you have shared any personal information of children under the age of 18 years, you represent that you have the
    authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <h3> Data retention</h3>
  <p>We retain your personal information for a period no longer than is required for the purpose for which it was
    collected or as required under any applicable law. Online data related to online behavioral advertising is kept by
    Cygnus for not more than 365 days after which it will expire, subject to certain conditions. However, the 365 days
    period may commence again if the same user subsequently visits or interacts with an ad, email, the Services or a
    channel. We may retain data related to you if there is a legal obligation to retain the data; if required to comply
    with any applicable statutory or regulatory retention requirement by law; if we believe it may be necessary to prevent
    fraud or future abuse; to enable Cygnus to exercise its legal rights and/or defend against legal claims; or for other
    legitimate purposes. We may continue to retain your data in anonymized form for analytical and research purposes.</p>

  <h3>Your rights</h3>
  <p>We take every reasonable step to ensure that your personal information that we process is accurate and, where
    necessary, kept up to date, and any of your personal information that we process that you inform us is inaccurate
    (having regard to the purposes for which they are processed) is erased or rectified. You may access, correct and
    update your personal information directly through the functionalities provided on the Booking Platform. You may delete
    certain non-mandatory information or delete your user account by logging into our website and visiting profile and
    settings sections. You can also write to us at contact@cygnusind.in to assist you with these requests.</p>

<h3>Consent</h3>
<p>
  By visiting our Booking Platform or by providing your information, you consent to the collection, use, storage,
  disclosure and otherwise processing of your information (including sensitive personal information) on the Booking
  Platform in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you disclose to us any personal information relating to other people

  the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
  You, while providing your personal information over the Platform or any partner platforms or establishments, consent to
  us (including our other corporate entities, affiliates, partners, technology partners, marketing channels, business
  partners and other third parties) to contact you through SMS, instant messaging apps, call and/or e-mail for the
  purposes specified in this Privacy Policy.
  You have an option to withdraw your consent that you have already provided by writing to us at contact@cygnusind.in .
  Please mention “for withdrawal of consent” in your subject line of your communication. We will verify such requests
  before acting on our request. Please note, however, that withdrawal of consent will not be retroactive and will be in
  accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, related terms of use and applicable laws. In the event you withdraw
  consent given to us under this Privacy Policy, may hamper your access to the Booking Platform or restrict provision of
  our Services for which we consider such information to be necessary.

</p>

<p>
We provide all users with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving non-essential (promotional, marketing-related)
communications from us on behalf of our partners, and from us in general, after setting up an account. If you do not
wish to receive promotional communications from us then please unsubscribe by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the
email or write to us at contact@cygnusind.in.</p>

  information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other
  websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. You have the option to
  opt-out from tracking personalized advertising using the “Opt out of Ads Personalization” settings using your device's
  settings application. Cygnus will have no access to your GAID once you select this feature.</p>
