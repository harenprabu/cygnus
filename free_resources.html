                    industry has a measurable contribution in the Indian Economy,
                    and contribution will only get higher in the near future.

                  <ol >
                    <li>
                      Travel and tourism is one of the largest industries in India, with a total contribution of over 247 billion U.S. dollars to the country’s GDP and estimated to double in the coming years. Although other parts of the economy sailed on turbulent waters in recent years, the tourism industry had grown as an important source of foreign exchange for the country. And for the people on the ground it has been creating jobs directly and indirectly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In 2017 Travel & Tourism directly supported 118,454,000 jobs (3.8% of total employment). This is expected to rise by 2.2% pa to 150,139,000 jobs (4.2% of total employment) in 2028.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In 2017, the total contribution of Travel & Tourism to employment, including jobs indirectly supported by the industry, was 9.9% of total employment (313,221,000 jobs). This is expected to rise by 2.5% pa to 413,556,000 jobs in 2028 (11.6% of total).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Visitor exports generated USD1, 494.2bn (6.5% of total exports) in 2017. This is forecast to grow by 3.9% in 2018, and grow by 4.1% pa, from 2018-2028, to USD2, 311.4bn in 2028 (6.9% of total).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Travel & Tourism investment in 2017 was USD882.4bn, or 4.5% of total investment. It should rise by 4.3% pa over the next ten years to USD1, 408.3bn in 2028 (5.1% of total).
                    </li>
                    
                  </ol>
                  <p><h4>GST (Goods and Services Tax) -</h4> It is the biggest indirect tax reform of India. GST is a single tax on the supply of goods and services. It is a destination based tax. GST has subsumed taxes like Central Excise Law, Service Tax Law, VAT, Entry Tax, Octroi, etc. GST is one of the biggest indirect tax reforms in the country. GST is expected to bring together state economies and improve overall economic growth of the nation.</p>
                  <p>The rate structure for the hotel and tourism industry went through various amendments in all these years after introducing GST Laws and below we are mentioning all these changes in GST Rates.</p>
                  <p>In the 37th GST council meeting, the union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has changed the GST rates on hotel rooms according to their tariff. Let us check out the revised GST rates on hotel room tariff from now onwards:</p>

                  <p>Before the introduction of the GST, the hotel & restaurant industry was facing problems due to a multiplicity of taxes which includes VAT, Service Tax, Luxury Tax, and even excise duties</p>
                  <p>Experts observe that the implementation of GST will help the sector by reducing costs for customers, harmonizing taxes, and reducing business transaction costs, but will also have its own set of challenges.</p>
                  <h4>Negative</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>	The major challenge is, who have centralized registration, need to have separate registrations for the states as well.</li>
                    <li>	Government grants the right to states for collecting GST on services.</li>
                    <li>Increased Compliance Burden- The procedure for all the invoices/receipts towards inward and outward supplies will become cumbersome as each one of them will have to be uploaded in the system. </li>
                    <li>The concept of credit matching under GST would be very difficult to handle and would lead to increase in working capital requirements. The frequency and number of returns to be filed will go up. In place of a half yearly service tax return, under GST law, one will be required to file state wise monthly three GST returns along with an annual return will also be required to be filed.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4>Positive Impacts of GST</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>•	GST was introduced with the motive of one nation one tax. GST has replaced the multiple taxes with one single tax. The lower tax rate slabs seem to attract more tourists in India.</li>
                    <li>•	Greater Revenue for State Government In case of Hotels and Restaurants the supply is shifted to a place where immovable property is situated. This increase the revenue for the states where they are located. Tax will be added on such income. While Union Government gets revenue from Service Tax on such services. Because of GST, the States having maximum tourist places, hotels or restaurants for tourist shall earn the maximum revenue by way of SGST which will be equivalent to CGST. </li>
                    <li>•	Companies specializing in food and beverages operations could be the biggest beneficiaries of GST within the hospitality sector. Food and beverages bills have multiple components which inflate the bills by 30- 35%. It is expected that GST to result in savings of 10-15% on the overall bill.</li>
                    <li>•	Services like Complimentary breakfast which was taxed separately under the VAT regime will be taxed as a bundled service under GST.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4>Conclusion: </h4>
                  <p>Well, there is an extensive impact of GST on the tourism industry. However, the people engaged in tourism require to be highly updated with the latest reforms in the GST regime. The introduction of GST in the form of SGST and CGST has given a say to both the government pertaining to the revenue generated in the form of tax. However, better utilization of Input tax credit is still expected and the rates should be revised to give a push and encouragement to the Tourism Industry.</p>
                  <p>It leads to the optimization of cost and betterment of the flow of the transaction. GST will definitely bring in the positive picture in the long run. Our Government of India has also been making amendments on the areas that need to be worked upon.</p>
